# Sentinel-AI
Stock Sentinel AI is an artificial intelligence system designed to analyze multiple stocks and determine which one is safest for long-term investors. It focuses on risk rather than return, using real stock data and AI-driven risk metrics to calculate a Safety Score and rank stocks from safest to riskiest.
